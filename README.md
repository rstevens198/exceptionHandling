# exceptionHandling
This program is from the book C# and .Net 

C# 6.0 and the .NET 4.6 Framework Andrew Troelsen, Philip Japikse

This is a basic program to show exception handling. 

Since the book modifies the program several times throughout the chapet I will make it so that each push is a different section of the program. That way users can look at the different pushes and see the progression that the book did.
